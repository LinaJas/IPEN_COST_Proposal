##1.1.	Challenge 
##1.1.1.	Description of the Challenge (Main Aim)
The IPEN initiative supports the creation of engineer groups working on (re)-usable building blocks, design patterns and other tools for selected Internet use cases where privacy is at stake. 

Participants in IPEN are from different areas such as data protection authorities, academia, open source and business development, and other individuals who are committed to the finding engineering solutions to privacy challenges. The objective of the work should be to integrate data protection and privacy into all phases of the development process, from the requirements phase to production, as it is most appropriate for the development model and the application environment.

It supports networking between engineer groups and existing initiatives for engineering privacy into the Internet. This network facilitates exchange in order to coordinate work and avoid duplication, in addition to discussing which privacy oriented use cases should be addressed with priority.

IPEN is building a repository of relevant resources, making its findings and knowledge base accessible to all participants, developers and privacy experts.



##1.1.2.	Relevance and timeliness
The rising popularity of the internet for uses in entertainment, commerce, education, and dissemination of information and ideas brings important benefits for individuals and society but also creates dangers to both through the ease of collection and processing of personal data. Although there is a growing body of European and National law for the protection of the fundamental right to privacy, personal data is increasingly collected on a massive scale and individuals do not have the ability to control or often even detect that. The protocols and standards underlying the internet have been built up over the years, and in the past not enough attention was payed to security and privacy of individuals. There is now an urgent need to define new standards more suitable for the data protection and security requirements of networks used by billions of people.

The conception of, and level of interest in, privacy has also changed hugely within the Internet technical community over the last two years. That is partly as a result of the Snowden relevations, but is also a trend that has been increasingly obvious for the last five or so years. This can be seen in the significant increasees in ciphertext in networks, for example with the proportion of email being protected with TLS as it is sent between servers having increased from an estimated 20% to above 90% when measured from a major email provider to most European and North American partners. There is a similarly increasing level of interest in the privacy aspects of many protocols, from HTTP/2.0 all the way down to MPLS. And within the IETF for example, RFC7258 has codified that trend so that privacy (in the sense of resisting pervasive monitoring) is an aspect that now needs to be considered in all protocol designs. The work however, has only really begun, as methods to mitigate traffic analysis are simply not well understood and much additional research and education (of protocol developers and implementers) is needed in that space. 



##1.2.	Objectives 
##1.2.1.	Research Coordination Objectives
###Objective.

Develop compliance procedures for how organisations subject to European Data Protection regulation should respect the DNT (Do Not Track) browser signal. Publish a document on the web that describes them, which companies can link to declaratively in the DNT Tracking Status Resource compliance property.




###Objective.

Develop a draft standard for cryptographically signed mark-up declaring the identity of data controllers and processors responsible for a web origin, with the aim of enabling user-agents to inform users of the legal identity and privacy policy of controllers who may collect personal data. Introduce this draft to the relevent W3C or IETF working group, and support the standards work necessary to complete it. 

###Objective.

Develop a draft standard for web session establishment and management by user agents, with the aim to give individuals visibility of and control over authenticated and anonymous sessions. This should be synchronised with existing IETF work on preventing security 
token export and replay attacks. Introduce this draft to the relevent W3C or IETF working group, and support the standards work necessary to complete it.

###Objective 

Foster the development of protocols and standards for anonymous unlinkable and virtualised network identity. The aim is to give web users control of how much identifiable information is shared. It should, for example, to be possible for users to manage and convey an audience categorisation to a publishers website without being tracked, and for individuals to browse the web anonymously if they wish. 

###Objective

Provide a forum allowing the technical Internet community to interact with data protection authorities and interested privacy researchers, so as to identify potential areas for conflict and potential areas for collaboration. The former may occur if one community embraces a change that is problematic for other communities. The latter could involve identification of areas where all communities recognise the potential for aiming to meet commensurate requirements. Note - the objective here is to identify and discuss such potential conflicts and areas for collaboration - the actual work to resolve conflicts or action collaborations is not intended to be done under the auspisces of this COST action.
