##1.1.	Challenge 
##1.1.1.	Description of the Challenge (Main Aim)
Protecting fundamental rights in the online sphere is made harder than it needs to be by the gap of understanding between technical, legal annd civil society communities.
Many people, from different areas such as data protection authorities, academia, open source and business development, and other individuals, are committed to the finding engineering and political solutions to privacy challenges. Broadly, we can speak of the technical community (developers, those working in technical standardisation such as with the IETF, the W3C and the ISO) and the legal community (those working in regulation such as data protection authorities). While there are of course some who overlap, given the scale of the challenge, there are not enough such people and action is needed to provide an ongoing and rich point of contact between the communities.


##1.1.2.	Relevance and timeliness
The rising popularity of the internet for uses in entertainment, commerce, education, and dissemination of information and ideas brings important benefits for individuals and society but also creates dangers to both through the ease of collection and processing of personal data. Although there is a growing body of European and National law for the protection of the fundamental right to privacy, personal data is increasingly collected on a massive scale and individuals do not have the ability to control or often even detect that it is happening. The protocols and standards underlying the internet have been built up over the years, and in the past perhaps not enough attention was paid to issues of security and privacy of individuals. There is now an urgent need to define new technologies and standards more suitable for the data protection and security requirements of networks used by billions of people.

The conception of, and level of interest in, privacy has also changed hugely within the Internet technical community over the last two years. That is partly as a result of the Snowden revelations, but is also a trend that has been increasingly obvious for the last five or so years. This can be seen in the significant increases in ciphertext in networks, for example with the proportion of email being protected with TLS as it is sent between servers having increased from an estimated 20% to above 90% when measured from a major email provider to most European and North American partners. There is a similarly increasing level of interest in the privacy aspects of many protocols, from HTTP/2.0 all the way down to MPLS. And within the IETF for example, RFC7258 has codified that trend so that privacy (in the sense of resisting pervasive monitoring) is an aspect that now needs to be considered in all protocol designs. The work however, has only really begun, as methods to mitigate traffic analysis are simply not well understood and much additional research and education (of protocol developers and implementers) is needed in that space. 



##1.2.	Objectives
##1.2.1.	Research Coordination Objectives

IPEN will launch projects for the development of tools and building-blocks which enable and enhance privacy. 
These projects are envisioned be both initiatives within Standards Development Organisations (such as the ISO, W3C and IETF) to help build consensus for procedures and interfaces that enhance privacy, and projects to develop and assemble open source building blocks made available to the wider technical community. Potential projects include:
  - Develop compliance procedures for how organisations subject to European Data Protection regulation should respect the DNT (Do Not Track) browser signal. Publish a document on the web that describes them, which companies can link to declaratively in the DNT Tracking Status Resource compliance property.
    
  - Develop a draft standard for cryptographically signed mark-up declaring the identity of data controllers and processors responsible for a web origin, with the aim of enabling user-agents to inform users of the legal identity and privacy policy of controllers who may collect personal data while they browse the web. Introduce this draft to the relevant W3C or IETF working group, and support the standards work necessary to complete it. 

  - Develop a draft standard for web session establishment and management by user agents, with the aim to give individuals visibility of and control over authenticated and anonymous sessions. This should be synchronised with existing IETF work on preventing security token export and replay attacks. Introduce this draft to the relevant standards body working group, and support the work necessary to complete it.
        
  - Foster the development of protocols and standards for anonymous unlinkable and virtualised network identity. The aim is to give web users control of how much identifiable information is shared. It should, for example, be possible for users to manage and convey an audience categorisation to a publishers website without being tracked, and for    individuals to browse the web anonymously if they wish. 

  - Identify ['usecases'](http://www.techopedia.com/definition/25813/use-case) - where tech engineers identify a series of steps that will enable them to solve a specific problem - for which privacy can be implemented at the design level.
    





##1.2.2.	Capacity-building Objectives
IPEN will provide a forum allowing the technical Internet community to interact with data protection authorities, internet engineers and interested privacy researchers, so as to identify potential areas for conflict and potential areas for collaboration. The former may occur if one community embraces a change that is problematic for other communities. The latter could involve identification of areas where all communities recognise the potential for aiming to meet commensurate requirements. Note - the objective here is to identify and discuss such potential conflicts and areas for collaboration - the actual work to resolve conflicts or action collaborations is not intended to be done under the auspices of this COST action.

It will also encourage IT specialists to develop privacy friendly solutions and to recognise the impact of their technical choices on users' privacy. Its aim is to integrate data protection and privacy into all phases of the development process, from the requirements phase to production, as it is most appropriate for the development model and the application environment.

##1.3.	Progress beyond the state-of-the-art and Innovation Potential 
##1.3.1.	Description of the state-of-the-art
The internet has grown from its roots in academic and Government sponsored research to become a major factor in the lives of billions of people around the world. The frenetic pace of this development has unfortunately left major components insecure against threats such as mass unwarranted surveillance and predatory commercial profiling. The lack of basic privacy protection components has led to a atmosphere where many business and technical developers do not have the necessary awareness of, and training in, the need for protection of fundamental human rights.

The main added value here is to provide a rich and ongoing point of contact between the technical and legal communities, who have, to date, not had such a venue for collaboration.

The IPEN action will link into ongoing privacy work in the IETF. <<details tbd>>
